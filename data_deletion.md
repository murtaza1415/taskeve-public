# Taskeve - Guide to Deleting Your Account Data

Welcome to the Taskeve app. We want to make sure that You are in full control of Your data when You use the Taskeve app. If You ever wish to delete Your data, You have two options to do so. Both these options will delete Your account from our servers and all data associated with Your account. Note that if You decide to delete Your data, You will lose it permanently and there won't be any way to recover it.
  
### Option 1: Delete Account from the App:
1) In the Taskeve app, login to Your account.
2) Open the Sidemenu.
3) Tap on the Settings icon.
4) Scroll to the bottom of the Settings page, and tap on "Delete Account and Data".
5) The app will prompt You to re-enter Your password. So re-enter Your password in the password field.
6) Tap on "Delete".
  
### Option 2: Request Deletion Via Email
If You can not access the app to delete Your account, or if You want to delete specific data without deleting Your entire account, You can send a custom request to murtazamail15@gmail.com. In order to prove account owenership, this request should be sent from the same email address that was used to create Your account.

### Retention Period:
Once You make a request to delete, it can take us up to 14 days to complete Your request and delete all data that is associated with Your account.

# Taskeve - Privacy Policy
Welcome to the Taskeve app. In order to ensure functionality of the app and to offer a smooth user experience, we have to collect some data from the app and store it on the backend servers. In addition, we require some device permissions when You install the app on Your Android phone. Continue reading below for our detailed privacy policy. 
### App Permissions (Android Device):
Following is a list of all the permissions that the Taskeve app requires to function on Your device, along with their purposes:
1) **Internet Access:** The app requires access to the internet so that it can communicate with the backend servers, for data retrieval and storage.
2) **Notifications:** The app has a feature to send You push notifications on the due date of a Task. You can enable or disable this feature from the Settings.
### Stored Data Types:
Following is a list of all the data items that are collected from the app and stored on the backend servers. We have also mentioned the purpose of storing each of these items:
1) **Email Address:** We store Your email address because it is essential to create and manage Your account.
2) **User ID:** We store Your User ID because it is essential to create and manage Your account.
3) **App content:** Content that You create on the app, which includes Your To-Do Lists and Tasks data, also needs to be stored. This is required so that You can retrieve and sync Your data across multiple devices.
4) **Firebase Installation ID:** In order to send You push notifications when a task is due, we need to uniquely identify Your App Installation with an ID. For this purpose, we collect and store Your Firebase Installation ID.
### Where is the Data Stored (Service Providers):
We use Firebase to provide a backend for Taskeve. This backend is essential to enable app functionality and provide You with a smooth user experience. Your data is stored on Firebase servers for this sole purpose. Firebase is an independent Service Provider owned by Google. Once You decide to delete Your account, we also delete all Your data that is stored on the Firebase services. To find out how Firebase handles Your data, here is a useful [article](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/play-data-disclosure) on the Firebase website. Other than the mentioned service providers, we do not share your data with any third-party.
### Data Deletion:
We want to make sure that You have the final authority regarding Your data. So we offer You multiple options if You decide to delete Your data. You can find the details in this [article](https://github.com/murtaza1415/taskeve_public/blob/main/data_deletion.md).
